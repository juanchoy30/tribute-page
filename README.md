# tribute-page

This project was made using bootstrap 4. Please remember to activate npm install in your version control command windows.

I decided to make this tribute page about Francisco Herrera Luque, who is one of my favorite writers.
I hope that people around the world get to know his work and a little bit of the culture of my country through it.
